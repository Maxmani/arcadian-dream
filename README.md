# Arcadian Dream <img alt="Icon" width="48" src="/src/main/resources/assets/arcadiandream/icon.png"/>

A Touhou mod for modern Minecraft. Arcadian Dream adds new blocks, items, mobs, and other content based on the [Touhou Project](https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Touhou_Wiki) series. It aims to provide a full Touhou experience in Minecraft.
The mod is still in early development and is not yet feature-complete. The mod is currently available for [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/) and Minecraft versions 1.19-1.20.

My code is not the best, and I'm still learning. If you see something that could be improved, feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
Some features are implemented in a different way than in previous Touhou mods, and I've tried to put my own spin on things.

## Features

Everything in the mod is subject to change. This list is not exhaustive.

### Current features

- A mostly working danmaku system
- Dozens of useful blocks and items
- New enchantments
- New structures
- A new crafting system
- Mobs that fire danmaku
- New ores to mine and process
- More advancements
- Highly configurable

### Planned features

- More of the above
- Laser danmaku
- New biomes and possibly dimensions
- In-game documentation
- And more!
- Seriously, I have a lot of ideas
